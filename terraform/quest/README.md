This is a Terraform configuration that deploys the MuShop basic sample application on [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)][oci].

MuShop basic is a 3-tier web application that implements an e-commerce site.
It is built to showcase the features of [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)][oci].
This application is designed to run using only the Always Free tier resources.
The repository contains the application code as well as the [Terraform][tf] code to create a [Resource Manager][orm] stack,
that creates all the required resources and configures the application on the created resources.

## Topology

The application uses a typical topology for a 3-tier web application as follows

## Build

### Build to generate stack (Stack will contain amd64 and arm64 binaries)

1. Clone <https://github.com/oracle/oci-quickstart-cloudnative>
1. From the root of the repo execute the command:

   - Create the Multi-Arch builder if not already created

     ```shell
     docker buildx create --name multibuilder
     docker buildx use multibuilder
     ```

   - Build image

     ```shell
     docker buildx build --pull --rm --load -t mushop-basic -f Dockerfile .
     ```

1. Generate Stack Zip Package for OCI Resource Manager

   ```shell
   docker run -v $PWD:/transfer --rm --entrypoint cp mushop-basic:latest /package/mushop-basic-stack.zip /transfer/mushop-basic-stack.zip
   ```

This creates a `.zip` file in your working directory that can be imported in to OCI Resource Manager.

### Build to run services locally. Multi-Arch (Example: linux/amd64, linux/arm64)

1. Clone <https://github.com/oracle/oci-quickstart-cloudnative>
1. From the root of the repo execute the command:

   - Create the Multi-Arch builder if not already created

     ```shell
     docker buildx create --name multibuilder
     docker buildx use multibuilder
     ```

   - Create the Multi-Arch builder if not already created

     ```shell
     docker buildx build --pull --rm --load -t mushop-basic -f deploy/basic/Dockerfile .
     ```

1. Run locally

   ```shell
   docker run --rm -it -p 8888:80 mushop-basic:latest
   ```

1. Browse to http://localhost:8888

## Deploying using local or OCI CloudShell _Terraform_ instead of ORM stack

After complete the Build steps 1 and 2, generate the binaries:

1. From the root of the repo execute the command:

   ```shell
   docker run -v $PWD:/transfer --rm --entrypoint cp mushop-basic:latest /package/mushop-basic.tar.xz /transfer/deploy/basic/terraform/scripts/mushop-basic.tar.xz
   ```

1. Copy mushop media images to populate the object storage:

   ```shell
   docker run -v $PWD:/transfer --rm --entrypoint cp mushop-basic:latest -vr /basic/images/ /transfer/deploy/basic/terraform/
   ```

1. Go to `$PWD/deploy/basic/terraform/`
1. Rename the file `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars`
1. Change the credentials variables to your user and any other desirable variables
1. Run `terraform init` to init the terraform providers
1. Run `terraform apply` to create the resources on OCI
1. To show sensitive outputs, use `terraform output autonomous_database_password` to show the ATP Admin password and `terraform output generated_private_key_pem` to show the private key for SSH access

## Running MuShop Basic APIs on Postman

Testing MuShop Basic Services APIs with Postman.

Note that these calls are intent to connect to the API endpoint, normally the ip address generated on the Load Balancer.
